Repository containing the CIF submission for Direct Secure Messaging Phase 3, v2.7.0, Build 4 received Jan 2020
Direct Secure Messaging Enhancements Phase 3 will implement the Large File Transfer capabilities along with the Direct Trust trust bundles (ATAB, GTAB & NATE) that will allow for secure exchange of information between the VA and Direct Trust partner providers. The project also includes establishing compliance with Regulatory and Security standards via the purchase and installation of the Hardware Security Module that securely stores partner encryption certificates. DSMEP3 will also provide enhanced delivery notifications and technical support to Direct Trust partners to ensure information needed to support Veteran care is accessible to providers. These enhancements will allow Veterans the access to quality care without losing continuity of medical history.
